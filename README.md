# A Javascript Chess Game

##For my Q1 project I decided to make a two player chess game with full validation of moves.

###Completed Goals:

* Hovering over pieces highlights valid moves for pieces.

* Game only allows for player driven valid moves.

* Allows for discovery check.  (moving a piece that reveals a check).

###Bugs to be fixed:

####Computer Play Mode -

* it will still move captured pieces,
* computer pawns can't tell the difference between pawn capture legality and pawn free space legality
* Black can't intelligently react to being in check


###Stretch Goals:

* To be able to play a computer that recognizes famous games situations and makes the best move.  (DEEP BLUE EMULATOR)
* Animation of pieces
* logic for castling and en passant
